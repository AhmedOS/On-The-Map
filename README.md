# On The Map
This app allows users to share their location and a URL with their fellow students. To visualize this data, On The Map uses a map with pins for location and pin annotations for student names and URLs, allowing students to place themselves ‚Äúon the map‚Äù.
Implementing this project was a part of my "iOS Developer Nanodegree" at Udacity.
